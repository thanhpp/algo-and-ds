### Have lots of fun attending to this adventure

## Somethings I learned along the way

- Solve the problem first: The problem is the fun part, coding just adding more constraints to it.
- Just go for it: Solve it in the most naive way, then build up from it.
- Visualize the problem does help a lot: a picture worths a thousand words.
- Know your goal: my goal is to learn Rust and solving problem, not competing for the world leaderboard. So I didn't need to fell uncomfortabl for not getting a high rank.
- Read other's solution: Some works are actually pieces of art.
- Write an understandable solution.

## Good algorithm

- Ray casting: determine if a point is in a polygon or not
- Shoelace formula: calculate the area of a polygon
- Z3 solver: Powerful solver if you are lazy ^^
